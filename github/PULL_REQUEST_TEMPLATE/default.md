/**
 * Formats a date object to 'YYYY-MM-DD' string format.
 * @param {Date} date - The date object to format.
 * @returns {string} The formatted date string.
 */
function formatDate(date) {
  const year = date.getFullYear()
  const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')
  const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0')
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`
}
```

## Benefits

[Explain the benefits of the changes made.]

**Ex:**

- **Consistency**: Ensures all dates across the application are formatted consistently.
- **Reusability**: The new function can be reused throughout the codebase, reducing code duplication.

## How to Test

[Provide a step-by-step guide on how to test the changes.]

**Ex:**

1. Import the `formatDate` function from the `utils` folder.
2. Pass a date object to the function and verify the output string matches the expected format.
3. Run unit tests to ensure all edge cases are handled correctly.

## Additional Comments

[Optional: Add any additional comments or notes that may be useful for reviewers.]
